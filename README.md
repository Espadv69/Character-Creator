# Character Creator

This project is a **Character Creator** built using **Vite** and **React**. It allows users to design and customize unique characters, supporting multiple classes such as Mage, Troll, and Goblin. The app provides two main sections: one for creating new characters and another for viewing existing ones.

## Features

- **Create Characters**: Design unique characters by selecting from various classes.
- **View Characters**: Browse a list of all previously created characters.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Built using class-based architecture to practice OOP principles.

## Steps to Build

1. **Setup the Project**:

   - Initialize the project using Vite and React.
   - Install necessary dependencies.

2. **Create the Main Menu**:

   - Implement navigation with two options: "Create Character" and "View Characters".

3. **Build the Character Classes**:

   - Define classes for each character type (e.g., `Mage`, `Troll`, `Goblin`) with specific attributes and methods.

4. **Develop the Character Creation Interface**:

   - Create a form for users to select a class and customize character attributes (e.g., name, stats).
   - Use the class constructors to instantiate new characters.

5. **Implement the Character Viewer**:

   - Display a list of all created characters.
   - Include details like class, name, and stats.

6. **Style the Application**:

   - Apply CSS for a user-friendly and responsive interface.

7. **Test and Refine**:
   - Test the app for bugs and ensure all features work as intended.
   - Optimize for performance and usability.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more character classes.
- Include a detailed view for individual characters.
- Enable editing and deleting existing characters.
